## Lecture 1

Tasks/ questions:  I’d recommend that you start with some basic tasks such as:
•	Import data (maybe one at a time or thinking about how you could import the seven files all in one go)

•	Explore data
-	Number of rows and columns
-	Column names
-	Content of columns ( what is stored where and how)
-	Range of the date variable ( earliest entry, latest entry)

•	Play around with the date variable and maybe transform it into a format that is easier to use (e.g. only includes year, month and day)
o	Next you could find out how many articles there have been in each month or how many of these have been published through ‘mirror.co.uk’
