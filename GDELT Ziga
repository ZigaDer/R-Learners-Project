#I downloaded just the first csv file, that's what I'll be working with 
#for the time being. Let's import it:
GDELT_gkg_f8_package1 <- read_csv("D:/R/Lib/GDELT_gkg_f8_package1.csv")

#Of course I picked a silly name so I now have to rename this dataframe to something prettier
GDELT1 <- GDELT_gkg_f8_package1
#Apparently a name is not a thing that exists (#deep?), so the best way is just to assign
#the dataframe to a new variable(name). There is no way to "rename" a dataframe. 

#removing its uglier twin:
rm(GDELT_gkg_f8_package3)

#let's count the columns
ncol(GDELT1)
#and now the rows
nrow(GDELT1)
#463324, that's a lot of rows

#what are the names of individual columns, you ask?
colnames(GDELT1)
#"idGKG"                   "dateTimeDocument"        "documentSource"         
#"themes"                  "themesCharLoc"           "locationsCharLoc"       
#"tone"                    "mentionedNumericsCounts"

#What's stored inside the columns. 
str(GDELT1)
summary(GDELT1)

#finding the earliest entry
GDELT1[which.min(GDELT1$dateTimeDocument),]
#taking that away from the last entry:
GDELT1$dateTimeDocument[which.max(GDELT1$dateTimeDocument)] - GDELT1$dateTimeDocument[which.min(GDELT1$dateTimeDocument)]
#gives a time difference of 44.98958 days.
